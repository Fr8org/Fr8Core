An Activity represents a discrete piece of functionality that can be carried out by a Terminal.  Terminals publish the set of Activities that they support, and Hubs make those Activities available to Clients providing user tools for creating Plans.

For example, An Email-oriented Terminal might publish Activities like “Send an Email” or “Download From Inbox”.

Actions are added to Plans during the Design stage. They are ordered in a linear fashion, like traditional workflows, but branching logic and loops are allowable.
